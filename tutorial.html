	This is a step by step guide for a full small RNA sequencing data
	analysis using the miRDeep2 package and its patched files. If you haven't installed them yet you can obtain the main package from 
	https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2
	and the patched files from 
	https://github.com/Drmirdeep/mirdeep2_patch		
	by clicking on Clone or download and then on Download Zip.
	
	Extract the zipped files and then open a command line window.

	If you have git installed you can obtain the packages also directly from the
	command line by typing 
	git clone https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2.git
	and
	git clone https://github.com/Drmirdeep/mirdeep2_patch.git
	
To install the miRDeep2 package enter the directory to which the package was extracted to. If you extracted the folder on the Desktop then typing
cd ~/Desktop/mirdeep2/ 
will bring you to the mirdeep2 folder.
Then typing 
perl install.pl 
will start the installer and download and install third party software. In particular. bowtie version 1, RNAfold, randfold and the perl packages PDF:API and TTF will be installed. Please follow the instructions on the screen. 

When mirdeep2 was installed successful then you can enter the directory of the mirdeep2_patch and 
type
bash patchme.sh
This will add the patched files to your mirdeep2 installation. 
After that we can start with the tutorial.
